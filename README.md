# blexer - compiler for b programming language
An endavour into what it takes to write a compiler.
Inspired by @tsoding and his [b](https://github.com/tsoding/b) repository.

> [!WARNING]
> Will most likely never be fully implemented

## Dependencies
 - [Python](https://www.python.org/) - the python programming language is used for the compiler

> [!WARNING]
> We provide our own (minimal, taken in the most literal sense you could ever imagine) standard library.

## Quick Start
```console
$ python b.py ./examples/hello.b -o hello
$ ./hello
```
